# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-KNN

Industry leaders like Netflix, Amazon and Uber Eats have transformed how individuals access products and services. They do this by using recommendation algorithms that improve the user experience. These systems offer personalized recommendations based on users interests and preferences. In this article we'll explore how to build recommendation systems in Python using content-based filtering and collaborative filtering methods. But before that lets understand more about Recommendation system.

About Recommendation System
Recommendation systems use data-driven methodologies to provide users with tailored suggestions. These systems utilize user data and algorithms to predict and suggest goods, services or content that the user is likely to find interesting. They are essential in environments where users are overwhelmed by vast amounts of content such as social media, streaming services and e-commerce platforms. Python is often chosen for building recommendation systems because of its accessible libraries and machine learning capabilities.

There are two primary approaches for building recommendation systems:

Content-Based Filtering: This approach suggests items based on the features of the items and user profiles. For example if a user liked a specific movie the system would recommend movies with similar attributes such as the same genre, director or actors.
Collaborative Filtering: This technique recommends items by analyzing user behavior and preferences, relying on the assumption that users with similar tastes will like similar items. For example if two users have liked similar movies in the past the system will recommend movies that one user liked to the other user assuming they would also like it based on their similar preferences.
